<<< Create a random quote generator >>>


- The quotes are generated randomly one by one with each JavaScript call

- Each quote is a combination of at least 3 sentence fragments.

- The quotes should be relatively coherent (no exclamation points in the middle of a sentence, for example)

- The program can simply display each result in the JavaScript console.

- Select the number of quotes generated (between 1 and 5)

- Choose between 2 types of quote generators (accordingly, you'll need two different sets of sentences)

- Once the quotes are generated, have the program generate new quotes or quit the program
